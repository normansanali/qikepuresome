Well, the 18-year-old has certainly achieved that — just probably not the way he intended. “D.G.T. (Off and On)” is sleaze rock with the emphasis on the sleaze (“I’m begging you, I’m on my knees / Take your clothes off / Step on me”) performed by an out-of-his-depth teen who succumbs to every cliché in the front man handbook. It’s hard to imagine anyone spinning their chair round for this.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clhgjv610002k3b6rejh9n4uj@published>36. “Tell Me More,” TuralTuranX (Azerbaijan)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clhgjv610002m3b6rbgaiyk2o@published data-word-count=88>Oh, dear. Once guaranteed to serve up a bona fide banger, Azerbaijan has this year decided to send a couple of Ed Sheeran wannabes with about as much charisma as a Eurovision-branded tea towel. Performed by identical twin brothers Tural and Turan Bağmanov, “Tell Me More” begins promisingly enough with an intriguing answerphone message narrative device and a jangly acoustic riff which may evoke Rachael Leigh Cook’s staircase reveal in She’s All That. But the pair then attempt to challenge Jack Harlow’s recent second-best-white-rapper claims and fail miserably.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clhgjv610002n3b6r8hlurjcl@published>35. “Duje,” Albina and Familja Kelmendi (Albania)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clhgjv610002p3b6rtesuxf4w@published data-word-count=93>Like so many of this year’s entrants, Albina Kelmendi found fame on The Voice, winning Albania’s fourth season in 2014. Unlike her fellow talent-show graduates, however, she’s brought her nearest and dearest along for the ride. Yes, that’s her brother, two sisters, mother, and father providing various degrees of stage presence and vocal quality on an Über-dramatic track about the hardships of keeping a united family.

Unfortunately, despite the recruitment of Eurovision-winning songwriter Wouter Hardy (Duncan Laurence’s “Arcade”), she doesn’t have the song. “Bridges” is the kind of meandering piano ballad you instantly forget about the moment its final overwrought note has played out.

Andrew Lambrou, who finished seventh in last year’s Australian selection final, delivers an impressive octave-spanning performance as the wounded soul: various TikTok clips have proven he can replicate those soaring “wooh”s in a live setting, too.

Vernicos wasn’t even born when Helena Paparizou gave the country its one and only victory in 2005. As with Switzerland’s&nbsp;Remo Forrer, Vernicos is obviously a fan of brooding British singer-songwriters with a somewhat relaxed approach to diction. (Good luck making out more than a few of its heart-on-sleeve sentiments.) But with its multiple shifts in rhythm, including a stadium-rock handclap finale, the self-penned and self-produced “What They Say” is at least a little more sonically inventive than all the other maudlin ballads.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clhgjv61300323b6r89d9yuhn@published>30. “Mama ŠČ!,” Let 3 (Croatia)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clhgjv61300343b6rr31o94qe@published data-word-count=109>Let 3’s “Mama ŠČ!” is practically unratable.

And it’s an anti-Putin song (albeit a cryptic one due to Eurovision’s nonpolitical stance) in which their Stalin-lookalike front man barks, “Mommy bought the tractor / Mommy kissed the moron.” You can’t imagine anyone voluntarily listening to this outside the contest, but you definitely won’t forget it.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clhgjv61300353b6rp3qvzkzm@published>29. “Blood and Glitter,” Lord of the Lost (Germany)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clhgjv61400373b6rbrrb9amh@published data-word-count=92>Industrial metalers Lord of the Lost recently reached pole position on the German album chart for the first time in their 16-year career.

But the Italian quartet, who beat “Blue” hitmakers Eiffel 65 during San Marino’s exhausting selection process, have actually been around since 2006. Despite some dodgy Spinal Tap–esque lyrics (“You have, you have a snake eyes / With the hips, with the sex that could paralyze”), the spirited “Like an Animal” should win them plenty of new fans.

While their entry was a sugary burst of girl-band Eurodance, Iru’s return is a highly dramatic — and slightly shouty — piece of avant-pop which appears to have gotten lost in translation (sample lyric: “This feeling is Lord”??). There’s a lot going on here, from the John Barry–inspired strings to the restless rhythms which could have escaped from an Arca album.

Even last year’s gentle folk number was at least performed in their native tongue. Sadly, their 2023 entry is as generic as they come. Former Got Talent graduate Diljá delivers a powerful Sia-like vocal, but the drum-and-bass-lite production never truly gets going and the self-empowering lyrics (“Go on, spread your wings and fly away”) sail a little too close to Hallmark-card territory.

Mia Nicolai and Dion Cooper were paired together by Duncan Laurence, the man who in 2019 brought the Eurovision microphone trophy home to Netherlands after a 44-year wait. The national hero also co-wrote this emotionally stirring duet which, unlike his winning entry “Arcade,” keeps listeners waiting for the big Coldplay-esque moment of catharsis.

Electronic duo Tvorchi, however, seem unlikely to follow in the footsteps of Ruslana, Jamala, and last year’s victors, Kalush Orchestra. Sure, they’ll no doubt have another strong sympathy vote in light of the country’s ongoing political turmoil.

Mengoni, who has described “Due vite” as “the story of a relationship between the ratio and the unconscious,” finished seventh while representing his homeland with a similarly melodramatic number in 2013.

Their Eastern European roots can certainly be heard in “My Sister’s Crown,” a frenetic protest against gender inequality which fuses girl-power pop and hip-hop with Slavic folk. It’s perhaps the closest this year’s contest comes to last year’s winner, although instead of breakdancing, the sextet serves up some well-choreographed marionetting. It’s also the type of divisive Eurovision entry that could just as easily challenge for the crown as prop up the rear.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clhgjv61a00453b6r3mspsr2j@published>17. “Eaea,” Blanca Paloma (Spain)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clhgjv61a00473b6rs9xcazex@published data-word-count=93>Blanca Paloma is currently fifth favorite to win the whole thing, perhaps something of a surprise considering how aggressively Spanish her entry is. Indeed, it’s hard to see the new flamenco of “Eaea” picking up as many televotes as last year’s “Solo,” the Latin pop return-to-form which gave Spain its highest placing since 1995. While that was firmly in J.Lo-esque territory in both style and sound, this tribute to Paloma’s late grandmother, Carmen, makes few concessions to the mainstream.

Singer Mimicat also sells the heck out of her three-minute cabaret show, no doubt overjoyed at finally getting to represent her country 22 years after her first attempt.

But “Dance (Our Own Party)” is instead a joyous funk-pop affair complete with knowingly ridiculous rhymes (“I feel better, in my sweater / Gaga Radio, is this a song you know”) and a sax hook that would make Kenny G proud.

Mae Muller, who’s already scored a “Hot 100” hit with Neikid and Polo G, appears to be the perfect foil, too, her spoken-word middle eight treading that fine line between camp and cringe.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clhgjv61g00553b6rytpjo5o7@published>5. “Samo mi se spava,” Luke Black (Serbia)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clhgjv61g00573b6r5batzl7l@published data-word-count=95>The man born Luka Ivanović adopted his showbiz surname to represent the 40 days of mourning he underwent over the apparent “death of the Serbian music scene.” You won’t be surprised, therefore, to hear that “Samo mi se spava” is positively dripping in melodrama. The brooding electro number was inspired by the alienation Black experienced during the pandemic, which perhaps explains the “Wake up, sheeple” sentiment and the elaborate staging in which he battles a giant robot controlling everyone’s dreams. It’s a Eurovision-meets-anime spectacle not a million miles away from Grimes at her commercial best.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clhgjv61h00583b6rn5p9c3qg@published>4. “Évidemment,” La Zarra (France)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clhgjv61h005a3b6r6fhouywk@published data-word-count=105>Canadians can enjoy a taste of what’s to come, having just learned that they’ll be getting their own Eurovision. The artist born Fatima-Zahra Hafdi will no doubt be hoping to follow in the footsteps of fellow Quebecer Celine Dion, who won the contest for Switzerland when she was just 20 back in 1988. She’s certainly got the confidence, vocal abilities, and stage presence required, while the slinky Gallic disco-pop of “Évidemment”<strong> </strong>is far more universal than France’s usual, resolutely French fare. La Zarra’s adopted nation finished second in 2021 and then second from bottom in 2022, but expect this to place closer to the former.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clhgjv61h005b3b6rxzlj7wfb@published>3. “Cha Cha Cha,” Käärijä (Finland)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clhgjv61h005d3b6rgs2boelz@published data-word-count=100>The act most likely to get Fox News viewers foaming at the mouth, Käärijä won the Finnish selection sporting an luminous-green, chest-exposing, latex-padded bolero jacket while harnessing a ballroom troupe in a routine that sat somewhere between the nightclubs of Berlin and Dancing With the Stars. So far, so Sam Smith. But whereas the latter’s sound rarely correlates with their new outlandish aesthetic, “Cha Cha Cha” is a relentless techno thumper every bit as arresting as its singer’s pudding-bowl haircut. While the juries are unlikely to reward such a melody-free entry, the televote could see this challenge for the top.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clhgjv61h005e3b6rdq6zbhc3@published>2. “Who the Hell Is Edgar?,” Teya and Salena (Austria)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clhgjv61h005g3b6rmvu83esa@published data-word-count=107>It’s the most pressing question of this year’s Eurovision. Who the hell is Edgar? Luckily, as the chants of “Poe” suggest, we soon learn the ghost that’s suddenly possessed this year’s Austrian entrants belongs to one of the literary world’s most macabre minds. Teya and Salena’s thumping Eurodance should be the sort of gimmicky nonsense that only really works in the confines of Eurovision. But there’s also substance to their deadpan style, with the pair sneaking in a clever anti-Spotify protest (“Zero, dot, zero, zero, three / Give me two years, and your dinner will be free”) in among all the operatic wails and David Brent–esque moves.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clhgjv61i005h3b6radtcmjhs@published>1. “Tattoo,” Loreen (Sweden)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clhgjv61i005j3b6rk7e8hu19@published data-word-count=103>Returning to the contest 11 years after triumphing with all-time great “Euphoria,” former Swedish Idol finalist Loreen is now aiming to join Ireland’s Johnny Logan in the extremely exclusive club of two-time victors. According to the bookmakers, every other nation might as well not bother turning up. “Tattoo,” a dramatic blend of strobing synths, sweeping Middle Eastern strings, and thunderous beats, does indeed sound like an instant runaway winner. And the staging, which essentially sandwiches the thick-fringed singer between two giant, slowly rising LED screens, only heightens the “wow” factor. Eurovision fans should perhaps already start planning their trips to Stockholm for 2024.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clhb11alr00000ph57kt8md6e@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Eurovision Song Contest Is Back This Week</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clh9vwut500000ijvavixc697@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Let’s Give a Close Listen to Eurovision 2023’s Six Front-runners</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>All 37 of This Year’s Eurovision Song Entries, Ranked</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdganymwsSrsGZqYGeAbrHUq6avoaOevK950qiloGWilrusscNnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fevery-2023-eurovision-song-ranked-html.html&title=All%2037%20of%20This%20Years%20Eurovision%20Song%20Entries%2c%20Ranked" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-2023-eurovision-song-ranked-html.html&description=All%2037%20of%20This%20Years%20Eurovision%20Song%20Entries%2c%20Ranked" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-2023-eurovision-song-ranked-html.html&title=All%2037%20of%20This%20Years%20Eurovision%20Song%20Entries%2c%20Ranked" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fevery-2023-eurovision-song-ranked-html.html&title=All%2037%20of%20This%20Years%20Eurovision%20Song%20Entries%2c%20Ranked" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fevery-2023-eurovision-song-ranked-html.html&text=All%2037%20of%20This%20Years%20Eurovision%20Song%20Entries%2c%20Ranked" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fevery-2023-eurovision-song-ranked-html.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Jenniffer Sheldon</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-09-07</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./anne-son-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-39624-html.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Anne Son Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./adeles-london-home-features-a-wine-store-and-an-energy-centre.html><h3>Adele's London home features 'a wine store and an energy centre' >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
