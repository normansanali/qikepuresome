They lock up once more, with Lyra applying a wrist lock. Blair blocks a hip toss attempt and transitions into a front face lock. Lyra retaliates with an arm wringer and front face lock of her own, skillfully landing on her feet after a snap mare. Lyra follows up with a hip toss, transitioning into a side headlock. She turns it into a cravate, but Blair fights back with a punch and a kick to break free.</p><p>Blair whips Lyra into the ropes, and Lyra floats over, attempting a sunset flip, but Blair blocks it and counters with a backslide. Lyra manages to block the backslide and executes a cravate takedown. Blair backs Lyra into the turnbuckles to escape, and as Blair is sent to the apron, she drops Lyra against the top rope. Blair then delivers a double stomp to Lyra’s back for a near fall, followed by a kick to the head and a neck breaker.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Blair transitions into a reverse chin lock that turns into a sleeper hold. Lyra finally escapes by getting Blair on her back and hitting a backpack stunner. Lyra follows up with punches and kicks, including clotheslines and a cross body. She adds head butts to the midsection and finishes with an enzuigiri. Lyra climbs the turnbuckle, but her cross body attempt misses when Blair ducks. Blair goes for a suplex, but Lyra blocks it and counters with a fisherman’s buster. Lyra floats over for another near fall. Blair strikes Lyra with forearms, but Lyra blocks a round kick and answers with a German suplex for a near fall. Lyra ascends to the top rope, but Blair stops her with a forearm. The two exchange forearms on the turnbuckles, and Blair goes for a Super Falcon Arrow. Lyra rolls to the floor after Blair executes the move.</p><p>Blair sends Lyra into the ringside barrier but misses a knee strike, crashing into the announce table instead. They eventually return to the ring, and Blair attempts another suplex, but her knee gives out. Lyra charges into the turnbuckles as Blair evades. Blair regains her composure and climbs to the top rope but misses a double stomp due to her injured knee. Lyra takes advantage, hitting a spinning back heel kick and following up with a Cradle Shock for the three-count.</p><p><strong>Winner: Lyra Valkyria (retains championship)</strong></p><p>After the match, Lola Vice appears with a contract but is stopped by Tatum Paxlye. Elektra Lopez attacks Tatum, leading to a brawl involving all four women until officials intervene.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Kelly Kincaid is backstage outside the medical room and announces that Ilja Dragunov is not medically cleared to compete tonight.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drew-gulak-damon-kemp-and-myles-borne-vs-carlito-joaquin-wilde-and-cruz-del-toro>Drew Gulak, Damon Kemp, and Myles Borne vs. Carlito, Joaquin Wilde, and Cruz del Toro</h2><p>The action begins with Drew and Cruz in the ring. Drew initiates with a wrist lock, but Cruz uses the ropes to reverse the hold. Cruz attempts to float over, but Drew doesn’t charge into the corner. Cruz responds with a side headlock and executes a head scissors takedown. Cruz gets sent to the ropes and responds with a springboard crossbody. Wilde tags in, and they perform a double back elbow, followed by Wilde hitting an assisted slingshot splash for a near fall. Wilde cleverly avoids Kemp, maintaining a wrist lock on Drew. He then leaps over Kemp, delivering a springboard dropkick while executing a wrist lock takedown on Drew.</p><p>Myles seizes the opportunity to attack Wilde while Drew distracts the referee. Subsequently, Drew, Myles, and Damon are all sent to the floor. Wilde seizes the moment and executes a slingshot crossbody onto Damon, Drew, and Myles on the outside.</p><p>Wilde connects with a missile dropkick on Drew for a close two-count. He follows it up with a series of punches to Drew. However, Myles intervenes with a knee to Wilde’s back while Damon distracts the referee.
