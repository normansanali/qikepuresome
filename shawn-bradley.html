Bradley's role with the school involves some of the functions of a vice principal, counselor, and coach. Describing Bradley, school executive director Ken Allen said, "Shawn has a great presence—due to his size—and has immediate credibility with the kids. His instant credibility when he's talking to kids makes him an incredible mentor. He is a great example of someone who has worked hard and been very successful. Being so tall wasn't always easy for him. He knows about being the 'odd kid' and dealing with that."</p><p>For much of his career, Bradley was inconsistent in scoring and rebounding, but he always excelled at blocking shots. He averaged 10.3 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game in his first season – good enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Second Team honors. But he shot a dismal 40.9 percent from the floor and constantly struggled with turnovers and foul trouble. He suffered a season-ending injury in February of that year, dislocating his kneecap in a collision with Portland's <a href=#>Harvey Grant</a>.</p><p>Bradley embraced yet another "fresh start" with a new franchise. With increased playing time in Dallas, Bradley posted some of the best numbers of his career. In a game against the Clippers, he tied his career high by scoring 32 points – the most ever by a center in the history of the Mavericks franchise. He also added a season-high 16 rebounds in that same contest. He finished the year with averages of 13.2 points and 8.4 rebounds per game – breaking career highs set during the previous season. But most importantly, Bradley provided strong defense in the paint that Dallas had been lacking before his arrival. In fact, Bradley finished the year as the top shot-blocker in the entire league, averaging 3.4 swats per contest. It was the first time any Mavericks player had ever led the NBA in any statistical category.</p><p>On March 19, 2010, Bradley filed papers to run as a Republican against incumbent Democratic Representative <a href=#>Tim Cosgrove</a> for the 44th District seat in the Utah House of Representatives. On November 2, 2010, Bradley lost the election to Cosgrove, earning 46.49% of the vote against Cosgrove's 51.13%.</p><p>Bradley played 7 more seasons in the league, remaining with the Mavericks until his retirement in 2005. Over that span, his playing time slowly declined, mainly due to some injuries and constant juggling of the team's lineups and rotations by coach Don Nelson. In particular, Bradley's offensive role became very limited, but he remained an imposing defensive presence. In fact, in the 2000–01 season, he broke his own team record by blocking 228 shots for Dallas – the highest total in the NBA that year. The Mavericks emerged as a perennial playoff contender, mostly due to the rise of star players such as <a href=#>Dirk Nowitzki</a> and Steve Nash, but Bradley's defense made a significant contribution. He finished his career with averages of 8.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in 23.5 minutes of action per game.</p><p>Bradley has competed internationally for Germany; he and Dallas teammate <a href=#>Dirk Nowitzki</a> were members of the German national basketball team that finished in fourth place at the EuroBasket 2001 in Turkey. In order to participate in this tournament, Bradley made use of his birth in Germany to obtain German citizenship.</p><p>Bradley has participated in many charitable endeavors. In the 2000–01 season he donated $25 for each blocked shot to Bryan's House, a managed facility for children affected by HIV and AIDS. He is a national spokesman for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. Bradley has also participated in the "Basketball Without Borders" program with other NBA players like <a href=#>Dikembe Mutombo</a>, <a href=#>DeSagana Diop</a> and <a href=#>Malik Rose</a> and found his experiences with children in Africa uplifting. He has also participated in treating leprosy colonies in India through the Rising Star Outreach.</p><p>And yet, Bradley continued to be plagued by maddening inconsistency that defined his entire professional career. During the 1997–98 season, Dallas coach Jim Cleamons experimented by bringing Bradley off the bench in several games (instead of his usual role as starter). In one particular game, it paid off in a major way: Bradley totaled 22 points, 22 rebounds, and a career-high 13 blocked shots in an April contest against the Trail Blazers. Bradley became the fifth NBA player to record at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocks in a single game, and the first to do so off the bench. The previous players to record a 20-20-10 game with points, rebounds, and blocks were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, <a href=#>Elvin Hayes</a>, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O'Neal. Bradley finished the year with a team-record 214 blocked shots; his average of 3.3 per game ranked third in the NBA.</p><p>Bradley lifted his game to new levels in March 1996. He posted a career-high 32 points and added 15 rebounds against Dallas early in the month, and set another career high a week later with 10 blocked shots against the Phoenix Suns. He recorded his first career triple-double in the very next game, tallying 19 points, 17 rebounds, and a career-best 11 blocked shots in another match-up against Mureşan and the Bullets. In April, Bradley posted back-to-back triple-doubles (against Boston and Toronto); in the process, he became the first player in NBA history to record consecutive games of double-figure blocked shots twice in a single season. His season averages for 1995–96 were 11.9 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.7 blocks per game – all career highs.</p><p>The Nets began the 1996–97 season under new management: John Calipari was named head coach in the off-season, and <a href=#>John Nash</a> replaced <a href=#>Willis Reed</a> as general manager. Reed had been a big believer in Bradley, but Calipari and Nash weren't nearly as excited about the 7-foot-6 enigma. In an effort to save some cash against the salary cap, the Nets traded their big center (and his big contract) to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster mid-season deal that involved nine players.</p><p>Bradley had a role in the film Space Jam in 1996, depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside <a href=#>Muggsy Bogues</a>, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. He also appeared as himself in an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger, and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in The Singles Ward movie. In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to <a href=#>Jimmer Fredette</a>, along with former BYU football star <a href=#>Chad Lewis</a> and legendary coach <a href=#>LaVell Edwards</a>. He has also appeared in an episode of Studio C.</p><p>Despite these highlights, Bradley continued to baffle and frustrate Philadelphia with his inconsistent play. Just 12 games into his third season (1995–96), the 76ers traded Bradley to the New Jersey Nets for <a href=#>Derrick Coleman</a>. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mureșan, leading the Nets to a 99–81 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mureşan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.</p><p>Philadelphia's management saw Bradley as a major project with huge long-term potential. The team acquired legendary big man <a href=#>Moses Malone</a> to serve as a mentor for Bradley, hoping to develop his skills in the low post. Also, the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant <a href=#>Pat Croce</a> and registered dietitian Jeanie Subach to add bulk to Bradley's skinny frame. His rookie season (1993–94) produced mixed results. In his first game, Bradley totaled just 6 points and 5 rebounds, but he did manage to block 8 shots in 25 minutes.</p><p>Bradley was heavily recruited by many colleges from across the country, but ultimately decided to play at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. During his freshman season (1990–91), he started all 34 games for BYU, averaging 14.8 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. But his main contribution to the team was shot-blocking: he led the entire nation in total blocks (177) and average (5.2 per game)—setting an NCAA freshman record in both categories. In one game against Eastern Kentucky (EKU), Bradley blocked 14 shots, tying the NCAA single-game record set by Navy's David Robinson in 1986. In that same game, Bradley also established a new career high by scoring 29 points.</p><p>Bradley played for Emery High School (Castle Dale, Utah) from 1987 to 1990. He was one of the most successful basketball players in Utah high school history, finishing with career averages of 20.3 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.4 blocked shots per game. During his time at the school, Emery racked up a 68-4 record and won two state championships. Bradley was named All-State three times and twice earned the season MVP award. In his senior year, he averaged 25 points, 17 rebounds, and 9 blocks per contest. He was named All-American by several national publications, including Parade Magazine, Street and Smith, USA Today, and others. He turned in a strong performance at the McDonald's All-American Game (12 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 blocks), earning the Most Valuable Player award for the West team. As of 2015, Bradley still holds Utah state records for blocked shots in a single game (18), season (209), and career (605).</p><p>Shawn <a href=#>Paul Bradley</a> (born March 22, 1972) is a German-American former basketball player who played center for the Philadelphia 76ers, New Jersey Nets, and Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
